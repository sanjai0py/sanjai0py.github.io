          Hi there! My name is Sanjai Kumar and I'm a
          <span id="age"></span>-year-old who loves building products with code.
          Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a curious mind and a fascination with
          how things work. This curiosity led me to the exciting world of
          programming and computer science, where I learned C and felt like a
          superhero! Since then, I've been working hard to improve my skills in
          computer science. I love reading books, especially those related to
          computer science and math. If you're interested, check out my
          <a href="./client/pages/readingList.html">reading list</a>
          to see what I'm currently reading. My projects and learning
          experiences are still driven by curiosity to this day. Recently, I've
          been obsessed with building compilers and parsers. I believe in
          following the first principle of thinking and I sometimes get

          exploring interesting topics, that's just because I'm always eager to

          Every day, I find myself immersed in the ever-evolving world of
          computer science, and I owe a huge debt of gratitude to the HN
          community for constantly enriching my knowledge. I eagerly embrace the
          opportunity to translate these newfound insights into tangible
          solutions for real-world challenges by actively participating in open
          source projects. As I navigate this digital realm, I've come to
          develop a deep affection for several technologies that continually
          inspire and captivate me, including:
